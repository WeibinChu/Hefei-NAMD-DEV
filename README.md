# Hefei-NAMD-DEV
Hefei-NAMD is an ab initio non-adiabatic molecular dynamics program based on time-dependent density-functional theory and surface hopping methods to investigate ultrafast dynamics of excited carriers and their coupling to other quasiparticles in real and momentum space, energy and time scale.
